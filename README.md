# Book-Co-V2

This repository is a way to see if I can improve myself at the same time as improving this project.

It may be tedious and a bit disorganized, but it's just a way to have fun and finding ways to improve how I can render this project

It started as a final year project when I started to learn how to code.

Books&Co is a platform for borrowing books between strangers in the same area for hand-to-hand exchange. We all have books that fill our shelves. Once read, they collect dust on our bookcases. On the other hand, we also want to read new books without necessarily wanting to buy them, for ecological, financial, or simply space-related reasons! The goal of Books&Co is to make its books available to others who wish to read them as lenders and to borrow a book from someone else as a borrower.

It would be great if I can expand the access to video games for example, or other stuff !
